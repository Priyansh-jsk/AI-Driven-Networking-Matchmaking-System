# AI-Driven-Networking-Matchmaking-System

**Objective:** Build a basic prototype of an AI-driven networking system that matches users with relevant peers based on their professional background, interests, and past interactions.

Requirements:

	•	Build a user profile generator using sample user data (can be synthetic) with attributes like industry, skills, project interests, and past validation activities.
	•	Implement a recommendation engine that suggests:
	•	Users who might benefit from connecting.
	•	Personalized networking opportunities based on past behavior.
	•	Use ML techniques (collaborative filtering, graph-based recommendations, or embeddings) to improve match accuracy.
 
Skills Being Tested:

✅ Recommender system techniques (collaborative filtering, embeddings, etc.)
✅ Graph-based AI (if applicable)
